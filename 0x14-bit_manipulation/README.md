#Binary to Unsigned Integer Conversion Function
This is a C function that converts a binary number represented as a string of 0 and 1 characters into its equivalent unsigned integer value. The function is named binary_to_uint and takes a single argument: a pointer to a string of 0 and 1 characters.

#Usage
To use the `binary_to_uint` function in your C program, you need to include its prototype in a header file or at the top of your source file:
`unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);`
